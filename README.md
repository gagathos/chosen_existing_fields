# chosen_existing_fields
Drupal 7 module for adding chosen toggle to the "existing fields" dropdown in field UI

This was created because scrolling through a long list of existing fields was a pain. 

You could theoretically set up chosen to act on this specific select ID, but I wanted to make it lightweight and toggleable. 

I'm not publishing to drupal.org because I don't feel it is adding very much and is more a development tool than anything.

This will add a small chosen icon (magnifying glass search icon) to your field UI. Clicking it turns the dropdown into a Chosen dropdown, which will allow you to filter the choices with a search box.
